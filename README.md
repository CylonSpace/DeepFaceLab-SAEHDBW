# DeepFaceLab - New Grayscale SAEHDBW Model and Code Review / Documentation of the source files

## Notes, experience, tools, deepfakes

~ 22.4.2022 -- Minor iterface changes (more keys for save, preview update etc.; changes of preview period and auto saving; later: forcing generation of new previews instead of keeping the same etc.); reviewing the code

~ 25.4.2022? --> Started working on SAEHDBW - Grayscale deepfake model; research, experiments, modifications of the channel dimensions, studying the NN model.

Goal: several times? higher performance, smaller models, higher resolution and/or more detailed models, although grayscale.

~ 27.4.2022 --> SAEHDBW - SUCCESS!

First correctly training version (last error fixed masks getting bug after untested change, numpy).
Initial mode: training from color input which is converted to grayscale during reading.
Now the model can train on 224x224 and 192x192 images on a 2 GB Geforce 750 Ti. (The quality etc. is to be checked at various AE dims, encoder dims, decoder dims.)

liae-ud-r192-ae-96-48-48-12-bw_SAEHDBW  x f, ~900ms (R192...-ae-64-48-48 - almost the same it time ~ 860 ms)
R224-AE64-48-48-12-BW_SAEHDBW x f ~ 1500-1600ms

Training on converted to grayscale pretrain faceset, resized to 384x384 (from 768x768). Checking how much details would be captured with different dimensions.

* SAEHDBW liae-ud-r96-32-32-16

Iterations: about 220-230 ms for batch size 8 and about 320-330 for 12 after 370K, training from color images. This model is still progressing. The faceset is currently about 400 images for Biden and 2200 images for the other person, where the Biden's are of a higher quality and sharper. Initially training only on about 200 stills of Biden, then about 200 frames from a clip of a lower quality. The model has small dimensions so very high quality can't be captured anyway.

...


Continuing working on the project.

Training with grayscale input (8-bit jpg, png) significant improvement (twice) for the pre-training dataset color images.
Modify Extract to extract to grayscale.
Unpacking the pretrain faceset, 768x768 color. Extract to 384x384 BW.

Similar function, ... but it's overriden in the separate models.

* If downloading the github repo and running the main.py as with Colab, it will run only on CPU. It must be built.
* If using the CPU version and newer OpenCV than 4.1, edit:
``` 
C:\Deepface\core\imagelib\warp.py

Locate:

def gen_warp_params ...

 random_transform_mat = cv2.getRotationMatrix2D((int(w // 2), int(w // 2)), rotation, scale) 
  random_transform_mat[:, 2] += (tx*w, ty*w)

#### (int(w // 2), int(w // 2)) #####
```

* Download the Builds and run/edit the .bat files
 
* After install, find trainer.py 
Change trainer thread: 

```
 while True:
        try:
            start_time = time.time()

            save_interval_min = 241 # 25  -- or whatever

```

To whatever you like.
