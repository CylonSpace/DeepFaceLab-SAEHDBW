Try also Live

* If downloading the github repo and running the main.py as with Colab, it will run only on CPU. It must be built.
* If using the CPU version and newer OpenCV than 4.1, edit:
``` 
C:\Deepface\core\imagelib\warp.py

Locate:

def gen_warp_params ...

 random_transform_mat = cv2.getRotationMatrix2D((int(w // 2), int(w // 2)), rotation, scale) 
  random_transform_mat[:, 2] += (tx*w, ty*w)

#### (int(w // 2), int(w // 2)) #####
```

* Download the Builds and run/edit the .bat files
 
* After install, find trainer.py 
Change trainer thread: 

```
 while True:
        try:
            start_time = time.time()

            save_interval_min = 241 # 25  -- or whatever

```

To whatever you like.
